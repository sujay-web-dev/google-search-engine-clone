Google Search Engine-clone-App-Made-from-Reactjs-with-Firebase-Backend

Used Google Search Engine API which is a feature from google , where we can include it in our app and it has free tier of 100 search per month.

Had played around With Google API Key to intergrate in this Website.

This project is built with React.js as front end framework and Firebase as a backend.
In this project I have used UseEffect, UseState React Hooks , &

Used Component Based Structure for build most UI,

 Used react-router-dom (BrowserRouter, Switch, Route, useHistory) for Navigating through diffrent pages

used the Material UI for Buttons, Avatar, Icons.
